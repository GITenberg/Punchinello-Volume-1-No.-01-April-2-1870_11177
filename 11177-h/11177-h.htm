      <p>Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1870, by
the
PUNCHINELLO PUBLISHING COMPANY, in the Clerk's Office of the District
Court of United States, for the Southern District of New-York.</p>
      <hr style="width: 45%;">
      <center> <img src="images/003.png" alt="PREFACE">
      <p><b>PUNCHINELLO, Vol. 1. No. 1.</b></p>
      <p>(Suggestion: "Take care of No. 1.")</p>
      <p>PUNCHINELLO TO THE PUBLIC, GREETING:</p>
      </center>
      <p>His name, PUNCHINELLO hopes, will not be found a difficult one
to
articulate. He flatters himself that it has a smack of grape-juice and
olives about it. It rhymes with "mellow," which naturally brings us to
"good fellow.". On occasions PUNCHINELLO can "bellow," cut a
"tremendous
swell," O, and he never throws away a chance of pocketing the "yellow."
He would like to rhyme with "swallow;" but alas! it can not, can not be.</p>
      <p>And yet, in spite of (or perhaps on account of) PUNCHINELLO'S
mellifluous name, much cavil has been brought to bear upon him.
(Prepare
to receive cavilry.)</p>
      <p>Squadrons of well-meaning persons with speaking-trumpets
marched to and
fro before the sponsors of PUNCHINELLO, each roaring at them to stop
such a name as <i>that</i>, and attend to <i>his</i> suggestion, and
his only.</p>
      <p>One did not like PUNCHINELLO because it means a "little
Punch," and
he&#8212;the speaking-trumpeter&#8212;liked a great deal; and lo! while he spoke,
he changed his trumpet for several horns. Then he was taken with a fit
of herpetology in his boots, and sank to advise no more.</p>
      <p>Another&#8212;a fellow with an infinite fancy for buffo
minstrelsy&#8212;was
vociferous that PUNCHINELLO should be called "Tommy Dodd." The
discussion upon this lasted for three months; but finally, "Tommy Dodd"
was rejected on account of the superfluously aristocratic aroma that
exhaled from the name.</p>
      <p>Four divisions of men with banners then came by, each division
respectively composed of members of the waning families of Smith,
Brown,
Jones, and Robinson, and each division bawled and thundered that the
name round which it rallied should be adopted instead of PUNCHINELLO,
on
pain of death.</p>
      <p>And thousands of others came with suggestions of a like sort;
for which
some of them wanted "stamps." And when they had all had their say,
PUNCHINELLO was called PUNCHINELLO, and nothing else&#8212;a name by which he
means to stand or fall.</p>
      <p>And now to business. PUNCHINELLO is not going to define his
position
here. He refrains from boring his readers with prolix gammon about his
foreign and domestic relations. He will content himself (and readers,
he
hopes) by briefly mentioning that he has foreign and domestic relations
in every part of the habitable globe, and that they each and all
furnish
him with correspondence of the most reliable and spicy character,
regularly and for publication. Among his foreign relations he is happy
to reckon M. MEISSONNIER, the celebrated French artist, to whom he is
indebted for the original painting from which PUNCHINELLO, as he
appears
on his own title-page, is taken.</p>
      <p>A preface is not the place in which to enlarge upon topics of
great
humanitarian interest, political importance, or social progress.
PUNCHINELLO will merely touch a few of such matters, then, and these
with a light finger. (No allusion, here, to the "light-fingered
gentry,"
for whom PUNCHINELLO keeps a large grape vine in pickle.)</p>
      <p>PUNCHINELLO observes the incipient tendency to return to
specie
payments. To this revival, however, he is not as yet prepared to give
his adhesion, though, on the whole, he considers it preferable to
relapsing fever, which is also noted on 'Change. Cuba shall have her
due
share of attention from him. And if She-Cuba, (Queen of the Antilles,
you know,) why not also He-Cuba?&#8212;lovely and preposterous woman, who,
from her eagerness to slip on certain habiliments that are masculine,
but shall here be nameless, shall henceforth be appropriately
distinguished by that name.</p>
      <p>Let other important topics take care of themselves.
PUNCHINELLO will
only add that he would at any time rather suspend the public plunderers
than <i>habeas corpus</i>, and that he means to take the gloss off the
grim
joke that "Hanging for murder's played out in New-York."</p>
      <p>It is pleasant for PUNCHINELLO to draw the attention of his
readers to
the fact that this, his First Number, is dated April 2d&#8212;the day after
All Fools' Day. This is cheering; since thus it is manifest that
PUNCHINELLO leaves all the fools and jesters behind, and is, therefore,
first in the race for the crown of comic laurel and the quiver of
satiric shafts.</p>
      <p>And now, by DAN PHOEBUS!&#8212;that's the DAN (ah!) that drives the <i>Sun</i>,
you
know, and is the biggest spot upon it&#8212;here we find that we have talked
ourself all the way to DELMONICO'S, and there's CHARLEY on the lookout.</p>
      <p><i>Punchinello:</i> "Good evening, Mr. DELMONICO; have you any
room for us?"</p>
      <p><i>Delmonico:</i> "You are very welcome, Mr. PUNCHINELLO, and
your rooms are
quite ready; for we have been expecting you ever so long. Of course,
your staff of artists can be accommodated in our Drawing-room, if you
will permit me to throw off so insignificant a joke."</p>
      <p><i>Punchinello:</i> "Tut, CHARLES!&#8212;'tis a joke of the first
water, (first
brandy-and-water, CHARLES.) Cap your joke with another as good, and
then
consider yourself on our staff. Lead us to our apartments, CHARLES."</p>
      <p>And so, looking from his pleasant Fifth Avenue windows,
PUNCHINELLO
waves a salutation to his audience with a "May you be happy, each and
all of you, and live all your days in clover," (admission ten cents.)</p>

THOMPSON, DANIEL DREW,
and REDDY THE BLACKSMITH, are hereby constituted Inspectors and
Canvassers for the grabbers.</p>
      <p><b>&sect; 4.</b> It shall be the duty of the said inspectors
to prepare a
registry-list of all the persons intending to grab, who are required to
serve a notice of intention through the post-office upon REDDY THE
BLACKSMITH, the Chairman. DANIEL DREW is to provide funds wherewith to
pay the postage.</p>
      <p><b>&sect; 5.</b> The registry-list shall be alphabetically
prepared, and the number
of chances shall be determined by dividing the number of grabbers by
the
number of offices.</p>
      <p><b>&sect; 6.</b> The grabbers shall be selected by lot.</p>
      <p><b>&sect; 7.</b> The lots shall be drawn by REDDY THE
BLACKSMITH from his own hat,
his eyes wide open, while every other inspector, and the voters, shall
be blindfolded with newspapers from the files of the <i>Christian Union</i>;
whereupon, as the names of the fortunate grabbers are called, each one
shall proceed to the grab-bag and grab his office.</p>
      <p><b>&sect; 8.</b> There shall be no repeaters of the process.</p>
      <p><b>&sect; 9.</b> The persons thus grabbing offices shall be
then and there, by the
Inspectors, declared duly elected to the offices grabbed, for life.</p>
      <p><b>&sect; 10.</b> Any vacancy occurring by assassination shall
be immediately filled
by the Inspectors appointing the assassin.</p>
      <p><b>&sect; 11.</b> Every person owning real estate on the
Island shall contribute one
ninety-ninth part of his income to the said grab-bag. On the following
Christmas, in the presence of the grab income-bents of offices, the
Inspectors shall proceed to divide the proceeds of these taxable
contributions, and one half of these proceeds shall be equally divided
among the grab income-bents of offices. The other half shall be devoted
to paving every conceivable surface of the city with wooden pavement.</p>
      <p><b>&sect; 12.</b> Owners of real estate in the city of New
York are hereby allowed
to make their own arrangements with the gas companies for the supply of
light; but nothing herein shall be construed to devote any part of the
proceeds to light the public streets at night and real estate owners
shall be allowed to make their own arrangements for the supply of water
with the grab income-bents of the Croton Grab Board.</p>
      <p><b>&sect; 13.</b> The sewers of the city shall be converted to
burial places for
persons assassinated at political meetings.</p>
      <p><b>&sect; 14.</b> Nothing herein contained shall be so
construed as to permit any
judge to grant an injunction against any grabbers of the offices.</p>
      <p><b>&sect; 15.</b> The "dead-beats," heretofore known as
policemen and soldiers of
the first division, are hereby legislated out of office, and it shall
be
a felony punishable with assassination for any one to go unarmed with a
six-shooter.</p>

      <p><b>HINTS FOR THE FAMILY.</b></p>
      <p>As it is intended that the mission of PUNCHINELLO shall be
extended into
all circles of society, that of the family shall not be neglected.
Every
other weekly journal abounds in wise domestic counsels, apt recipes,
cunning plans, and helpful patterns of all sorts; and PUNCHINELLO,
intending to offer the most advantages, expects to become so necessary
to the economical housewife and the prudent bread-winner that no family
will be able to do without him. So, with no further prologue, we will
present our readers with some valuable hints in regard to the use that
can be made of things that often lie about the house gathering
dust&#8212;idle clutter and of no service to any body. <img
 src="images/005a.png" align="left" alt=""> The first hint, we
know, if followed up, will be found of the greatest advantage to all,
yielding great measure of convenience at little cost. Take a wide
board&#8212;as wide as you can get it&#8212;and as long as it will cut without
cracks or knotholes, and saw the ends off square. Then bore four large
holes in the corners, and insert the ends of four sticks, each about
three feet long. Place it upon the floor, so that the board will be
supported by the sticks, thus:</p>
      <p>This contrivance will be found very useful for various
purposes. It will
do to put books upon, to write upon, to iron clothes upon, and for any
other purpose where it is considered desirable to support household
objects at a distance from the floor. One of its chief advantages is to
serve as a receptacle for the food of a family during meals. If on such
occasions it be covered with a white linen or cotton cloth, its
appearance will be much improved, and in time it can not fail to become
a favorite article of furniture.</p>
      <img src="images/005b.png" align="right" alt="">
      <p>The next hint will please the ladies. Take two pieces of
cotton or
woolen cloth, of any size from two inches to a foot square, and sew
them
together at the edges, leaving, however, a small place unsewed at one
corner. You will now find that you have something like a square bag.
This is to be tightly filled with wool, bran, mowings, clippings of
human hair, or something of the kind, and the open corner is then to be
sewed up. When finished, the affair will assume this appearance and
will
be found very useful for the preservation of pins. The manner of using
it is as follows: you take the pin in the hand and firmly press it into
the bag, when it will be found that the body of the pin will easily
enter, but that the head will prevent its entire disappearance. The
stuffing of the bag will retain the pin in its position until a slight
degree of force is used to withdraw it. With the use of this ingenious
little contrivance, pins can be kept in safety with the points always
hidden and their heads exposed to view. It will be found much more
economical and convenient than the plan of carrying pins loose in the
pocket, and eventually will be generally adopted, we think. The top and
corners can be ornamented <i>&agrave; discr&eacute;tion</i>.</p>
      <p>Hint the third is especially addressed to country families.
Take one of
the ordinary toilet-tables that are to be found in so many rural
habitations, and, on removing the white cover, you will probably find
that the table is formed of an empty flour-barrel with a board nailed
on
top of it. Remove this board; get a head from another barrel of the
same
size; place it properly upon the top; put some good hoops around the
ends, nail it all up tightly, and you will find that you will have a
very good barrel.</p>

      <p><b>THE MARINER'S WRONGS.</b></p>
      <p>Within the memories of men who are not yet old, the sailor was
always
looked upon and talked about as "a jolly dog." There was a glamour of
romance about him when he was at sea, and "JACK ashore" was for ages
held up as the presentment of all that was happy, and contented, and
free from care. His hardest duty was supposed to be shinning up the
ratlin to "reef," or "brail up," or "splice the mainbrace," or do some
other of those mysterious things that caused him to look so mythical to
the minds of land-lubbers and the simple-hearted kind of women that
used
to be, but now no longer are. His lighter hours (about eighteen out of
the twenty-four) were passed in terpsichorean performances on the
"fo'k'sl," and were so fascinating to the shorey mind that music was
specially composed for them, and the "Sailor's Hornpipe" is one of the
scourges inflicted upon mortals, for their sins, by barrel-organists at
the present day. Grog was dealt out to him by the gallon, and, as for
"backy," the light-hearted fellow was never allowed to suffer for want
of <i>that</i>; so that his happiness may be said to have been
complete.</p>
      <p>Things are sadly changed, now, with regard to poor JACK. Every
day we
read of outrageous assaults upon him with marline-spikes and other
perverted marine stores, by brutal skippers and flagitious mates, whose
proper end would be the yard-arm and the rope's end. All belaying-pin
and no pay has made JACK a dull boy. His windpipe refuses to furnish
the
whilom exhilarating tooraloo for his hornpipe. Silent are the "yarns"
with which he used to while away the time when off his watch and
huddling under the lee of the capstan with his messmates. And then,
when
he comes ashore, it is only to be devoured by the sharks that lie in
wait for him and drag him away bodily to their obscene "boarding-house"
dens.</p>
      <p>Once on a time JACK, when in dock, used to make holiday of it
on Sunday.
He looked as gay as a tobacconist's sign when rigged out in his best
blue for a lark ashore, where he was occasionally to be seen on
horseback with a row of his jovial messmates, all of them sitting with
their backs to the horse's head, and the sternmost of them steering the
bewildered animal by his tail. Now there seems to be a movement to cut
off from JACK even the holiday to which he is surely entitled. The
captain of a bark, lying at San Francisco, has lately stopped wages, to
the amount of sixty-five dollars, from a seaman, because the latter
refused to assist in discharging cargo on Sunday. Blue has, in one
sense, always been JACK's favorite color; but if this sort of thing
goes
on much further, he must become bluer than ever, and his cheerless
condition will be such that he will not have a cheer left to shake the
welkin with when he helps to man the yards.</p>

      <p>HAMLET&#8212;WITH A YELLOW WIG.</p>
      <p><img src="images/007.png" align="left" alt="The"> poet&#8212;his
name is of no consequence&#8212;has defined the evening
as</p>
      <p>"The close of the day when the HAMLET is still."</p>
      <p>Evidently he was a bucolic, and not a metropolitan poet.
Otherwise he
would have remembered that the close of the day, or, to speak with
mathematical accuracy, the hour of eight P.M., is precisely the time
when the HAMLET of a well-regulated theatrical community begins to make
himself vocally prominent. A few nights since, we had no less than
three
HAMLETS propounding at the same time the unnecessary question, whether
to be or not to be is the correct thing. The serious HAMLET of the
eagle
eye, and the burlesque HAMLET of the vulpine nose, are with us yet; but
the rival of the latter, the HAMLET of the taurine neck, has gone to
Boston, where his wiggish peculiarity will he better appreciated than
it
was in this Democratic city.</p>
      <p>The late Mr. WEGG prided himself upon being a literary
man&#8212;with a
wooden leg. Mr. FECHTER aspires to be a HAMLET&#8212;with a yellow wig. Mr.
WEGG had this advantage over Mr. FECHTER, that his literary ability did
not wholly depend upon his ligneous leg. Mr. FECHTER'S HAMLET, on the
contrary, owes its existence solely to his wig. The key to his
popularity must he sought in his yellow locks.</p>
      <p>There are, it is true, meritorious points in Mr. FECHTER'S
Dane. One is
his skill in fencing; another, the fact that he finally suffers himself
to be killed. Unfortunately, this latter redeeming incident takes place
only in the last scene of the play, and the Fat Prince has therefore
abundant previous opportunity to mar the superb acting of Miss
LECLERCQ.
Why this admirable artist did not insist that her OPHELIA should
receive
a better support than was furnished by Messrs. BANGS, LEVICK, and
FECHTER, at Niblo's Garden, is an insoluble mystery. She must have
perceived the absurdity of drowning herself for a Prince&#8212;fair, fat, and
faulty&#8212;who refused to give her a share of his "loaf," and denied, with
an evident eye to a possible breach of promise suit, that he had given
her any "bresents."</p>
      <p>That Mr. FECHTER speaks English imperfectly is, however, the
least of
his defects. If he could not speak at all, his audience would have
reason for self-congratulation. We might, too, forget that he is an
obese, round-shouldered, short-necked, and eminently beery HAMLET, with
a tendency to speak through his nose. But how can we overlook his
incapacity to express the subtle changes of HAMLET'S ever questioning
mind? One of his admirers has recently quoted RUSKIN in his support.
MR.
FECHTER gives no heed to RUSKIN'S axiom, that all true art is delicate
art. There is no delicacy in his conception of HAMLET. True, he is
impulsive and sensitive; but this is due to his physical and not to his
mental organization. A HAMLET without delicacy is quite as intolerable
a
spectacle as a <i>Grande Duchesse</i> without decency.</p>
      <p>What, then, has given him his reputation? The answer is
evident;&#8212;His
yellow wig. NAPOLEON gilded the dome of the <i>Invalides</i>, and the
Parisians forgot to murmur at the arbitrary acts of his reign. Mr.
FECHTER crowns himself with a golden wig, and the public forgets to
murmur at the five acts of his HAMLET.</p>
      <p>In all other respects Mr. FECHTER'S HAMLET is inferior to that
of his
rival Mr. FOX. It is not nearly as funny, and it is much less
impressive. Both actors are wrong, however, in not omitting the
graveyard scene. To make a burlesque of Death is to unlawfully invade
the province of Messrs. BEECHER and FROTHINGHAM.</p>
      <p>The popularity of Mr. FECHTER is only a new proof of the
potency of
yellow hair. It is the yellow hair of the British blonde, joined to
that
kindliness of disposition with which&#8212;like a personification of
Charity&#8212;she "bareth all things," that makes her a thing of beauty in
the eyes of R.G.W., and a joy for as many seasons as her hair will keep
its color. It is because Mr. FECHTER decided that the hair presumptive
of the Royal Dane must have been yellow, that his name has grown famous
in England.</p>
      <p>The veracious chronicler relates that, on one occasion, Mr.
VENUS
deprived his literary friend with a wooden leg of that useful
appendage.
But that act of constructive mayhem did not destroy Mr. WEGG'S literary
reputation. Can MR. FECHTER'S HAMLET endure an analogous test? If he
has
confidence in himself, let him try it. He has gone to BOSTON for a
change of air. When he returns to NEW-YORK, let it be for a change of
hair. When he succeeds in drawing full houses to see him play HAMLET
with raven curls, we shall believe that he is something more than
simply
a HAMLET&#8212;with a yellow wig. Until then we shall be constrained to class
him with the other blonde burlesquers.</p>

      <p><b>PUNCHINELLO IN WALL STREET.</b></p>
      <p><img src="images/011.png" align="left" alt="T">hat it is not
PUNCHINELLO'S intention to overlook Wall
street, may be
absolutely taken at par. To look over Wall street is quite another
matter, and P. knows how to do it to a T. Many a time at midnight, from
his perch on the tip of the spire of Old Trinity, (a tip-top point from
which to look over Wall street&#8212;you see the point?) has PUNCHINELLO
beheld the ghosts of dead speculations floating hopelessly through the
murky air. It could not be said of them that there was "no speculation
in those eyes." The ghost of a dead speculation was never so utterly
damned, the eyes of a ghost of a dead speculation were never so
absolutely dimmed, but that speculation of some kind might be discerned
fluttering like a mummy-cloth from the shadowy outline of the former,
and gleaming feebly from the gloomy goggles of the latter. Gleam on,
poor ghosts! Goggle while you may, and gibber. PUNCHINELLO watches you
with interest, (25 per cent.,) as you are weighed down to the very dirt
of The Street by the night-fog of Despair, flapping your wings on a
very
small "margin," as if attempting vainly to "operate for a rise." Go
down, poor ghosts; repair to your incandescent place below, for there
is
no hope for you. As we sit here upon our spire, we can not say to you, <i>Dum
spiramus speramus</i>. Alas! no. We would like to do so,
of course;
but our sense of truth revolts against the enunciation of such a
taradiddle.</p>
      <p>Soon after daylight has been fully turned on, it is the wont
of
PUNCHINELLO to descend from his perch on the church, (rhyme,) and roam
waywardly and invisibly among the denizens who occupy the dens of The
Street. He knows all the ins and outs of the place, and has long been
disgustingly familiar with its ups and downs. Gently has he dabbled in
stocks, and no modern operator is half so conversant an he is with the
juggles of the Stock Exchange. PUNCHINELLO, though as fresh and frisky,
in mind and body, as a kid on a June morning, is older than he chooses
to let every body know. Bless you all, readers dear! he was by when the
Tulip Mania was hatched, (mixed figure,) and it was he who punctured
the
great South Sea Bubble, and sent it on a burst. Ha! ha! he-e-e!--how he
laughs when he recurs to those days of the long, long ago, with their
miserable little swindles, no better than farthing candles, (allowable
rhyme,) and their puny dodges devised for flagellating LUCIFER round a
stump.</p>
      <p>Just think of a lot of fellows pretending to play at
Tulipmaniacs
bolting Bubble-and-squeak, and not a jockey among them all had ever
heard of "puts" and "calls." Deuce a one of them know a "corner" from a
cockatrice's egg, and if you had mentioned a "scoop" to the most
intelligent of them, he'd have sworn that you had been and gone and
swallowed a Scandinavian dictionary. (N.B. In this application the nave
in Scandinavian might properly be spelt with a k.) Ah! yes, yes:
What-d'ye-call him was wide-awake when he remarked to Thingumbob that
"the world <i>does move</i>."</p>
      <p>How strong the contrast to PUNCHINELLO as he glides,
invisible, to and
fro among the bulls and bears on 'Change, observing the "modern
instances" of their improved manner of doing business, and taking all
their devices into the corner of his brightest eye! (The only safe
"corner" <i>he</i> knows of on The Street.) How he chuckles as he
observes
the ways of 'em&#8212;sees a bear selling that which he hasn't, and a bull
buying that which he doesn't want&#8212;all "on a margin" and to "settle
regular," of course. Bless you! children of the modern Mammon. Go in
and
win, or lose if you find it more exciting. Learn to control finances,
if
you would fain grow to be good men and contribute hereafter good men to
the taxable population. Proceed with your virtuous transactions on
'Change. Never mind each other's toes; they who have corns must not
care
for being cornered. (Meant playfully.) Inflate the market with your
heavy purchases. Blow the market, and "corner the shorts." Be a "bear,"
if you will; and when you play at "bull," remember the frog in the
fable, who would be an ox, and went on inflating until he burst.</p>
      <p>You bloated stockmonger there, with your hands in your pockets
and your
eye on the mean chance, what care you how much capital is represented
by
certificates issued? "That's played out," you say? You know it is, you
slimy salamander, and so does PUNCHINELLO. You know that by the use of
convertible bonds capital can be increased or diminished <i>ad
infinitum</i>.
Loan your millions to Erie, to save it from destruction or the Sheriff,
(synonymous terms,) and you will derive sweet consolation from the
consciousness of your power to add or diminish at will.</p>
      <p>Look at the "Great Waterer." When he chose to "snake away"
Erie from its
friends, and make it tributary to New-York Central, the printing-press
was at work&#8212;a fact which he did not discover until he had paid out ten
millions. Then the foreigners purchased ream after ream of certificates
to control Erie, and to-day their stock is declared not worth a row of
pins, owing to the piles of money swallowed by the afflictive suits on
the stamped certificates.</p>
      <p>Observe SNIGGER and SNAGGER, too; mark the goings and comings
of these
partners in business and iniquity. How regularly they have kept
swearing
that their business never paid, and yet their dividends always
increased
when they wished to distribute their stock.</p>
      <p>And here is one who&#8212;more audacious, far, than King CANUTE of
old&#8212;would
control even the ocean. This man starts a Pacific Mail with a capital
of
ten millions, increases the amount to twenty millions, and swears it is
worth thirty. Then he "puts his foot in it" and shows the knave in his
deal, (dealings&#8212;jocular,) by selling the stock at thirty-five.</p>
      <p>This from PUNCHINELLO, as he looks over The Street&#8212;and through
it&#8212;from
his lofty pinnacle. Don't strain your precious eyes and necks in
fruitless endeavors to discover him there, since he can make himself
invisible at will. But listen, ye men of The Street, with all your
ears,
(Erie,) and you will hear a solemn chant like unto that of the <i>muezzin</i>
from the minaret. 'Tis the voice of PUNCHINELLO wafting sonorously from
his tower the instructive moral&#8212;</p>

      <p>It was well said by a saucy Frenchman, "that England had fifty
religions

that she has a dozen different pavements and deuce a good one. There
was
the "Russ," on which the horses used to be "let slide," but couldn't
trot; the "Belgian," of dubious repute; the "Nicholson," which, from
its
material, must have been invented by "Nick of the Woods;" the
"Mouse-trap," set to catch other things than mice; the "Fiske," a
pavement pitched in altogether too high a key to be pleasant; The
"Stafford," the "Stow," and several others which it would be painful to
enumerate here. Why doesn't the daily press look lively, and devise a
better pavement than any of these? There's STONE, of the <i>Journal of

      <hr style="width: 45%;">
      <p><b>MR. GREELEY'S AIDS TO LITERARY EFFORT.</b></p>
      <p>On the general principle that "no one is a hero to his valet,"
not even
a valetudinarian, it may be safely asserted that the divinity that doth
hedge most great writers is lost the moment their admirers become
acquainted with their habits of thought and methods of composition. The
popular delusion that H.G. "knows every thing" is calculated to work
indefinite injury to some modest men who are supposed to "know
something." GREELEY'S mind, like a <i>camera obscura</i>, may be said
to
retain its impressions while in the dark, and to lose them when exposed
to the light. He has never, to any extent, heeded the scriptural
injunction against walking in darkness, which explains why so many <i>Tribune</i>
readers are in the dark concerning the truth and
justice of
popular questions. Consequently, as in the case of other great men,
when
GREELEY'S mind becomes pregnant with a theme, moved to pity by the
neglected education and limited mental resources of many of his
readers,
he repairs to one of his numerous literary lairs, and ransacks the
pages
of the Past for plunder befitting his pen and party. When he is about
to
write an editorial article on Protection, he invariably prepares his
mind by reading several chapters on the "Manly Art of Self-Defense,"
which accounts for the wisdom and brilliancy displayed by him on the
subject of tariffs. In order to approach a discussion of the subject of
vegetarianism without prejudice, H.G. repairs to the wheezy WINDUST'S,
where, for hours at a time, he literally "crams" with his favorite dish
of pork and beans. The Amelioration of the condition of the Working
Classes is another favorite theme with GREELEY, and, in order to
discuss
clearly and cogently the many phases and ramifications of this lively
and exciting topic, he devotes several hours to the study of "Idleness
as a Fine Art." Before writing a particularly funny or spirited article
upon Politics, the Fine Arts, or the Drama, H.G., it is said, may be
seen for several hours at the Astor Library, poring over BURTON'S <i>Anatomy
of Melancholy</i>. While in the throes of literary
labor upon <i>The
Great Conflict</i>, he had numerous dogmatic discussions with Mr. KIT
BURNS, participated in several flights of the "fancy" to the
bird-battling haunts of New Jersey, and even pursued the ministers of
muscle to the scene of their bucolic pastimes in the P.R. It is,
perhaps, unnecessary to remark that Mr. GREELEY'S <i>Recollections of
a
Busy Life</i> were inspired almost directly by frequent collusion with
the
pages of DE QUINCEY and COLERIDGE, whose wild lives and turbulent
experiences possess a peculiar charm for the Triton of the <i>Tribune</i>.
When Mr. GREELEY wishes to write against capital punishment&#8212;which he
does about every time the moon changes&#8212;he naturally turns over a few
pages of <i>Thirty Years in Washington</i>. When he purposes to tempt
the
bounding bean of the kitchen garden of Chappaqua, or humble the hopeful
harrow of agriculture, he may be found either at the Italian Opera,
serenely sleeping under the soporific strains of <i>Sonnambula</i>, or
at the
Circus, benignly blinking at the agglomerating Arabs. The inspiration
for that thrilling story in real life, entitled, <i>What I Know about
Farming</i>, is said to have been received almost wholly from the state
of
somnolency induced by that clever clairvoyant, the Rev. Dr. CHAPIN. A
curious notion exists in the minds of a few ignorant persons, to the
effect that Mr. GREELEY vexes his mellow mind for essays on the
temperance question with frequent and numerous imbibitions of "soda
straight;" but it is high time that this popular error was exploded.
All
who have seen Mr. GREELEY in the bar-room of a certain city hotel,
dashing down brandy or pouring down whisky, and have next morning
perused a Tribune editorial on "The Evils of Intemperance," need not be
reminded of the chief source of H.G.'s animated style and vigorous
diction. An extended walk along the beautiful avenues of the city, or a
drive through Central Park, invariably prepares Mr. GREELEY's mind for
the birth of an article on the advantages to young men of leaving the
metropolis and seeking homes in the West. Some months ago, Mr. GREELEY
purchased a small, select library, which contains, among other choice
works, the sweet pastoral productions of SYLVANUS COBB, Jr.; the quaint
and exhilarating narratives of EUGENE SUE; the wholesome and harmless
fictions of NED BUNTLINE, together with the complete poetical works of
MARTIN FARQUHAR TUPPER, and it was from the perusal of these comforting
and pellucid contributions to American literature that Mr. GREELEY
caught the spirit and the style which distinguish his thrilling work on
Political Economy. But something too much of this. We would not
embitter
the life of Mr. GREELEY, at present, by any farther revelations, and
therefore we let the subject drop.</p>
      <hr style="width: 45%;">
      <p><b>CONDENSED CONGRESS.</b></p>
      <p>SENATE.</p>
      <p><img src="images/013.png" align="left" alt="A">t the opening,
Senator SUMNER rose to a personal explanation.
In fact,
he always does. He said that General PRIM had disowned having had any
thing to do with him upon the Cuban question. General PRIM was
perfectly
correct. (Applause.) He did not know much about the Cuban question; but
he flattered himself that he was familiar with the gurreat purrinciples
of Eternal Justice, and he intended to apply them to the solution of
all
our political problems. He said that Lord COKE had justly and
eloquently
observed <i>de minimis non curat lex.</i> He thought this would apply
to our
relations with the Island, where, although the sugar-cane lifts its
lofty top and the woodbine twineth, the accursed spirit of caste still
prevails. He begged to bring to the attention of the Senate and the
country the amended lines of the sacred poet:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 50%;">
      <div class="poem">
      <p></p>
      <div class="stanza">
      <p></p>
      <p>"What though the spicy breezes</p>
      <p class="i2">Blow soft o'er Cuba's isle;</p>
      <p>Though every prospect pleases,</p>
      <p class="i2">And only man is vile?"</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>The Senate would say with CICERO, <i>de non apparentious et
non
existentibus, eadem est ratio</i>, and they would remember with
reference
to the revolutionists of Cuba the great saying of Lord BACON, "Put a
beggar on horseback, and he will go to the Senate from Massachusetts."
Whatever the issue of the Cuban contest might be, he could lay his hand
upon his heart, and say with the Mantuan bard, "<i>Homo sum</i>." or,
in the
language of our own Shakespeare, that which we call a rose by any other
name would smell as sweet. These were all the sentiments he could find
in his library which bore directly upon this subject.</p>
      <p>Senator SUMNER then introduced a bill to provide for the
resumption of
specie payments. The bill sets forth that it shall hereafter be a
felony
for any person to make tender of any thing other than gold and silver
to
any person of African descent, in any of the States lately in
rebellion.
In moving the bill, the senator said that its passage was imperatively
demanded by several negroes whom he knew, and that he would not consent
to deliver these helpless persons into the hands of their late masters
without some such guarantee as this bill furnished. He quoted from
ARISTOTLE, LOCKE, and BURKE to prove that classes liable to oppression
were apt to be oppressed.</p>
      <p>Senator TRUMBULL wished to know what that had to do with the
resumption
of specie payments.</p>
      <p>Senator SUMNER considered the inquiry impertinent. The great
principles
of justice were always in order.</p>
      <p>Senator GARRET DAVIS took the floor, and made a neat speech of
three
days and a half in opposition to the bill. He said he was a Democrat,
and he always had been a Democrat. The founders of the republic would
weep if they could see what the government had come to. What would CLAY
and CALHOUN have said to seeing such men as his honorable friend from
Nevada (Mr. NYE) and himself in the Senate? If he might be permitted to
infringe upon the domain of the senator from Massachusetts, he would
quote Shakspeare, "What should such fellows as I do, crawling between
heaven and earth?" (Loud applause.) At the close of Mr. DAVIS'S speech
his friends came in from WELCKER'S, and congratulated him on having got
through. Exhausted nature made the Senate adjourn.</p>
      <br>
      <p>HOUSE.</p>
      <p>After some general sparring, of which a set to between Mr.
GARFIELD and
Mr. HAIGHT formed the most conspicuous feature, the cadetship question
came up. Mr. VOORHEES explained that he never had sold any cadetships.
Mr. LOGAN wished to know who said he had. Mr. VOORHEES remarked that
Mr.
LOGAN was another. Mr. VOORHEES explained that he had appointed the son
of a constituent, and that subsequently to the appointment he had taken
a drink at the expense and the request of the constituent. He always
took his straight, and the cost to his constituent was only fifteen
cents. Which one of his colleagues would have acted otherwise? (Voices,
"Not one.")</p>
      <p>Mr. BUTLER denounced the course of Mr. VOORHEES. For his part,
he saw no
impropriety in selling cadetships or any thing else. What do gentlemen
suppose that cadetships exist for, if it is not for the emolument of
congressmen? He considered his patronage as a part of his perquisites.
This had been the guiding principle of his life, alike in his military
and his political career. He considered the action of Mr. VOORHEES to
be
an act of deliberate treachery to this House. If he accepted a pitiful
drink in return for his official influence, he was guilty of a gross
offense in cheapening the price of patronage. A cadetship was worth
$500
if it was worth a cent. If, on the other hand, he gave his cadetship
away, his conduct was even more culpable; for other congressmen might
be
weak enough to follow his baleful example, and the market would be
broken down. He advocated the formation of a Congressional Labor Union
to determine the value of these appointments, and to expel all members
who took less than the standard rate. This was what was done in other
branches of business, and if his colleagues wished to be like him, the
little busy B.F.B., and improve each shining hour, this is what they
would do.</p>

sparkling, and the incidents thoroughly natural."</p>
      <p><i>From the Cincinnati Chronicle.</i></p>
      <p>"There is a singular freshness about this novel, often a
quaint originality of expression, always a smooth rippling of
words not without ideas, of seed thoughts, many of which are
well worth cherishing, and which may germinate and grow
in the reader's mind long after he has forgotten that 'Red
as a Rose is She,' and has ceased to wonder as to who is the
author who has so pleasantly entertained him."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
